# Credit_Card_Transaction_Analysis
This repository showcases a comprehensive Credit Card Transaction Analysis project, which focuses on analyzing customer credit card transactions and related customer demographics to uncover valuable insights for business decision-making. The project was built using Power BI, utilizing real-world credit card transaction data and customer information to create interactive dashboards that provide a deep understanding of the business's financial performance and customer profiles.

1. Credit Card Transactions: Contains transaction details, including revenue, interest, transaction type, and card type.
2. Customer Details: Includes demographic information like income, marital status, education, and customer satisfaction scores.

Data Transformation:
1. Imported and cleaned data from two CSV files using Power Query Editor in Power BI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
2. Created additional calculated columns for better analysis, such as age group, income group, week number, and revenue.
3. Applied DAX formulas to calculate key metrics like Current Week Revenue, Previous Week Revenue, and Week-on-Week Revenue.
